My goals where to study inheritance, learn lambdas in ruby, learn currying in Ruby.

I have utilized inheritance by creating Media superclass and DVD and Book classes that inherited from the Media superclass.
I used a lambda function with currying of another lambda function to create due date extention functionality.
